# React Router Dom v6 Routes Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when upgrading from React Router v5 to v6: routes failing to render correctly despite seemingly correct configuration.  The problem stems from subtle differences in how routes are defined and handled between the two versions.

## Problem

The original `App.js` uses React Router v6's `Routes` and `Route` components, but the pages do not render as expected.  The issue is likely due to incorrect path definitions or a missing component that should be present for the routes to function correctly. 

## Solution

The `AppSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation using the same components, addresses the path definitions to accurately direct to each page.  This should resolve the routing problems, ensuring that each route component renders as intended.

## How to run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

You can then navigate to `/`, `/about`, and `/contact` to test the routing functionality.
